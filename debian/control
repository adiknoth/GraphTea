Description: Educational framework to work on graphs
 GraphTea is a software framework to work on graphs and social networks. It
 helps you to:
 .
   * draw a graph
   * get reports about it
   * run algorithms on it
   * visualize it
 .
 What can you do with graphtea?
 .
   Drawing your graph with mouse or using predefined graphs like trees,
   complete graphs, stars, generalized peterson and etc.
 .
   Getting information about your graphs like num of connected components,
   chromatic number, independence number, girth size, num of triangles and
   etc.
 .
   Run algorithms step by step on your graph and see how they work. This is
   very useful for teaching graph algorithms. You can pause, and it shows
   the current state of algorithm by coloring edges and vertices.
  .
   Visualizing your graphs. You made a social network from your database
   and want to represent it in a meaningfull way? Use the visualizations.
  .
   Presenting your graphs in your papers, websites or reports. GraphTea has
   a wide range of options to draw graphs, having different colors for
   edges and vertices, different borders, fonts, and sizes and etc. When
   you finish drawing your graph, you can save to a image file or even to a
   Latex document to put in your report, then you can use latexcad app, to
   further refine your graph.
